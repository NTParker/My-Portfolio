# My-Portfolio

In this challenge, I created a portfolio page using HTML and CSS to showcase my past work and provide background/contact info for potential employers. This web page utilizes CSS flexbox and media queries in order to provide the user with a responsive layout that adapts to their screen size. Additionally, the page includes images of my previous work that, when clicked, takes the user to the deployed application. The page is organized by section in the taskbar where the user can click on a specific section title and be redirected to that section. 

Screenshot of deployed webpage:
